# Fisher’s Iris Data Set project

## Problem statement

This project concerns the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set It is a research of the data set, inclluding documentation and code .

The program file called analysis.ipynb does: 

1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,  
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and  
3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.

## Background

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. 

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).

Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
