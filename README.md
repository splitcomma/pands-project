# Fisher’s Iris Data Set project

## Problem statement

This project concerns the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set It is a research of the data set, inclluding documentation and code 

The program called analysis.py does: 

1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,  
2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and  
3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.

## Background

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
